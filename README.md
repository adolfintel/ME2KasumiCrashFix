# Mass Effect 2 Kasumi Crash Fix

This ASI mod fixes a crash that occurs on modern systems at the end of Kasumi's loyalty mission, when returning to Normandy after defeating the boss.

For use with Erik-JS's [Binkw32 proxy DLL](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32)

__Consider this an EXPERIMENTAL fix: I'm currently doing a complete run of the game on Windows 10 to see if it causes problems elsewhere__

It should work with all versions of the game: Steam, Origin, Disc and "DRM-free üòè".

## Installation
* Install [Binkw32 proxy DLL](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32) (follow his instructions)
* Download ME2KasumiCrashFix.asi from [here](https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=kasumi-asi) on this page
* Copy ME2KasumiCrashFix.asi to the game's Binaries folder, next to MassEffect2.exe
